Repo to support the Medium post: All-time top footballers are born in October, truth or myth?

This is a myth (or maybe not) that has been a topic for discussion in pubs and football TV shows sometimes. See this [article](https://placar.abril.com.br/placar/outubro-e-o-mes-dos-craques-confira-os-aniversariantes-do-futebol/) (in PT-BR) that Placar, Brazil's leading sports magazine, published in Oct-2021 about this. See the whole Medium post here.

## Intallation

The whole analysis and modelling was done with Jupyter Notebook, using Python 3.*.

## Files descriptions

The goal of the project ends with the findings and answering the question "is this a myth?" so there is no need to deploy the model's predictions, only to interpret its coefficients under different approaches. Therefore, the `.ipynb` file contains all that it is needed to replicate this project's findings. 

## Results

This [Medium post](https://medium.com/@gbfernandes2002/truth-or-myth-october-is-the-month-of-the-aces-of-football-c6507f0a9cca) provides the findings of the analysis.
